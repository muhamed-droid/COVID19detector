# COVID19detector

This is done for university project. Objective was to create a program that recognizes COVID-19 pneumonia in dataset of many pictures. 

It works in ubuntu, and it is not perfect. 

This project can be used for some more complicated and more applicable purposes.

It was a pair work with my colleague.
